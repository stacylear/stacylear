It all started with Lemonade Stand. 

It's the early 80s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">WarGames</a> has just come out, and I'm about to start fourth grade. It's summer in the south, and I go to a sleepover at my best friend's house to find that her dad as given her a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> for her birthday. Because she's the best of best friends, she lets me play with it, and the first thing I run is... <a href="https://c64online.com/c64-games/lemonade-stand/">Lemonade Stand</a>.

I'm hooked. 

:computer: I'm hooked on computers.<br> 
:game_die: I'm hooked on gaming. <br>
:dollar: I'm hooked on finance. 

And that's my origin story. :lemon:
